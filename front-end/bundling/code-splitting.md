# Code Splitting

Have number of types:

1. Component-based. Clicking a link and waiting for a page to load
2. Route-based. Modals, tabs, and many more UI components aren't loaded until the user has done
something to reveal them
3. Prefetch. We defer loading content until higher priority content is finished loading
